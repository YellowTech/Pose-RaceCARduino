# Pose-RaceCARduino
Control a Bluetooth enabled ESP32 Robot using your arms!

This project uses a React webinterface and the Web Bluetooth API to control an ESP32 based microcontroller that is part of a simple twin-motor RC car. Specifically, this project used a LILYGOÂ® TTGO T-Display ESP32 WiFi and Bluetooth Module that includes an ESP32, a TFT display and lots of IO ports although it can also run on a generic ESP32 when removing the TFT specific Code.
